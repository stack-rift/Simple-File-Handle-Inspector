# Simple File Handle Inspector

A utility for checking which processes are using a specific file or folder, directly from the Windows context menu.

---

## ⚙️ Features

- Adds context menu entries for files and folders:
  - 🧩 `Find which process is using this file`
  - 📂 `Find which process is using this folder`
- Uses Sysinternals' `handle.exe` to detect file locks
- Displays the process name, PID, and full executable path
- Includes a cleanup shortcut to remove the context menu entries

---

## 🪛 Installation and usage

1. **Run the `configure.bat`**  
   This sets up the context menu entries.

2. **Right-click a file or folder → choose the new context menu item**  
   The utility will open and show the processes that are locking the file or folder.

## 🧹 Cleanup

**To uninstall/remove the context menu entries, run the `cleanup (run before deleting the utility).bat`**

This will safely remove all registry entries.

After that, it's safe to delete the utility folder.

## 🪟 Windows 11 Notes

Due to UI changes in Windows 11, context menu entries may appear under **"Show more options"** (Shift + Right Click).  
This is a Windows limitation and cannot be bypassed via registry keys alone.
